# WeatherApp ( inspired of using new technologies cooperating in project, big thanks to creator of such these great technologies and also references)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Set up server Expressjs using Typescript to synchronize with UI on Angular, fetch API retrieved data and send to ElasticSearch Cloud Host for analytics, visualizations and managing.

Required packages for Typescript support on Nodejs: @types/node, typescript (global install recommend)

Create ElasticSearch Cloud Host together with processors for managing and with Kibana Console for analytics, visualizations and more.

## Apply Firebase services on Angular for authentication and authorization with some references about UI on PrimeNg(thanks to the creators of such great UI component-my favorite besides MUI as reference and use when needed). Inspired of using LocalStorage(compared to SessionStorage over the stability) and using RxJS with the help of Observable pattern.

Create new project on Firebase and add the relevant services of Firebase, apply configurations in environment on Angular(here hences my general configurations for Angular project), 

import modules then start writing API handlers.
